*Software Engineer | Java Spring Boot | DevOps & Cloud Enthusiast*

## 👋 About Me  
I’m Hardik — a 23-year-old software engineer based in Rajkot, Gujarat, India.  
I’ve been working with Java and Spring Boot, building microservices and backend systems.  
I’m now diving deeper into DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, Dockerizing microservices, deploying on Rocky Linux with Terraform, multi-tenant architectures and AWS.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me learning Spanish and exploring how to deliver resilient systems at scale.

## 🔧 Skills & Tech Stack  
**Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Batch  
**Frontend:** Angular, (also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
**DevOps / Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS EC2, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
**Architectures:** Microservices, multi-tenant database patterns, event-driven systems  
**Other:** Git, Linux (Rocky Linux, Ubuntu), SQL/NoSQL, REST/HTTP APIs  
**Languages:** English (fluent), Gujarati & Hindi (native), Spanish (learning)  

---

## 🎯 Current Focus  
- Building a CI/CD pipeline from scratch for Spring Boot and Angular applications.  
- Dockerizing services, managing containers with Kubernetes.  
- Deploying onto Rocky Linux servers, using Terraform to automate infra.  
- Implementing multi-tenant microservices: separate DB per tenant, shared code, isolated data.  
- Learning Spanish so I can broaden my horizons and collaborate globally.

## 🧩 Projects  
Here are some of my recent/resource-worthy projects:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hyperpure-style Platform** | A full‐stack site & mobile app (in progress) modeled after a clean “supply-chain to consumer” platform—planning backend (Spring Boot), frontend (Angular), mobile, and DevOps infrastructure. |
| **Spring Batch + HTTP Endpoint** | A Spring Batch job exposed via HTTP, running on AWS EC2, deployed via CI/CD — part of my DevOps/automation journey. |
| **Multi-tenant Microservices Demo** | Prototyping a system where each tenant has its own database, services share code but maintain isolated data. |
| **Docker & Kubernetes Learning Series** | Step-by-step labs and hands-on tutorials as I build my DevOps muscle. |

## 🌱 Continuous Learning  
- 🐳 **Docker**: From basics to advanced, diving deep into containerization and microservices architecture.  
- 🔄 **DevOps/Infra**: CI/CD pipelines, Terraform + AWS EC2, Kubernetes orchestration, Rocky Linux.  
- 🌍 **Languages**: Spanish — currently at beginner/middle level; improving daily with apps and conversation.  
- 🧠 **Algorithms/Data Structures**: Consistently brushing up so I stay sharp, especially given my interest in backend and system design.

---

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate  
I’m open to:  
- **Research or practical projects** involving microservices, optimization, or distributed systems.  
- **Open source contributions** — especially in the DevOps, tooling or backend space.  
- **Networking** with engineers, DevOps practitioners, or Spanish-speaking developers worldwide.

Feel free to connect — I’d love to chat about architecture, deployment strategies, multilingual dev teams, or anything in between.

## 📫 Fun Facts  
- ⚙️ I built my first microservice at age 22.  
- 🗣️ I can say “Hola, ¿cómo estás?” but still stumble over past-tenses in Spanish.  
- 🎮 I find system design discussions almost as fun as videogame level design.

Thanks for stopping by — and happy coding!
